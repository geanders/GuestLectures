# Overview

## Community-wide effects of ambient exposures

Today, I'll talk about two popular study designs for studying the **community-wide effects** of **ambient environmental exposures** on human health outcomes. 

The two study designs are: 

- **Time series**
- **Case-crossover**

## Community-wide effects of ambient exposures

- Inform policy choices
- Evaluate effectiveness of interventions or policy changes
- Gives clues to biological mechanism

## Impact of NMMAPS 

Research impacts of NMMAPS package

- As of November 2011, 67 publications had been published using this
data, with 1,781 citations to these papers 
- Research using NMMAPS has been used by the US EPA in creating
  regulatory impact statements for air pollution (particulates and
  ozone) 
- "Thanks to NMMAPS, there is probably no other country in the
  world with a greater understanding of the health effects of air
  pollution and heat waves in its population.""

# Example data: Chicago NMMAPS

## `chicagoNMMAPS` data

For the examples in this lecture, I'll use some data from Chicago on mortality, temperature, and air pollution. These data are available as part of the `dlnm` package. You can load them in R using the following code:

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
library(dlnm)
data("chicagoNMMAPS")
```

## `chicagoNMMAPS` data

To make the data a little easier to use, I'll rename the data frame as `chic`:

```{r, eval = TRUE}
chic <- chicagoNMMAPS
chic[1:3, c("date", "cvd", "temp", "dptp", "pm10")]
```

## `chicagoNMMAPS` data

To find out more about this data, you can look at its help file:

The model we fit is: 

$$
Y(t) \sim Quasipoisson(\mu_t, \sigma^2)
$$
$$
log(\mu_t) = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}PM_{t} + f(t) + Z(t)
$$

where: 

- $Y(t)$: Daily mortality count in community $t$
- $PM_t$: Daily $PM_{10}$ count
- $f(t)$: Smooth function of time
- $Z(t)$: Other confounders

## Confounders

Day-of-week trends in daily mortality and particulate matter, Chicago, IL

## Confounders

- Measured confounders
    - Temperature
    - Dew point temperature
    - Day of the week 
- Unmeasured confounders
    - Long-term time trends
        - Changing population size
        - Changing population demographics
    - Seasonal time trends
        - Respiratory infections
        - Influenza
        

## Controlling for confounders

Some cofounders you might want to fit using a more complex form. For example, the relationship between temperature and mortality is often non-linear, with the lowest risk at mild temperatures and increasing risk as temperature gets colder or hotter.

# Implementation: Time series studies

## Overdispersed Poisson example

For example, say we wanted to fit an overdispersed Poisson regression for the `chic` data of whether cardiovascular mortality is associated with particulate matter (note: in this simplified example, I'm not controlling for many things we normally would, like season and temperature).

```{r eval = TRUE}
mod_d <- glm(cvd ~ pm10, data = chic,
             family = quasipoisson())
summary(mod_d)$coef[ , c(1, 2, 4)]
```

## Overdispersed Poisson example

Here, the model coefficient gives the **log relative risk** of cardiovascular mortality associated with a unit increase in PM\textsubscript{10} concentration.

## Controlling for confounders

We usually want to control for other confounders. For example, when we look at the association between PM\textsubscript{10} and cardiovascular mortality, we probably want to control for things like day of the week, seasonal and long-term mortality trends, and temperature. 

We can control for these potential confounders by adding them in to the right-hand side of the formula: 

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Note: This is pseudocode
[health outcome] ~ [exposure of interest] + 
                   [confounder1] + [confounder 2] ...
```

## Controlling for confounders

For example, we usually want to control for day of the week as a factor. To do that, first make sure that day of the week has the class `factor`:

```{r eval = TRUE}
class(chic$dow)
```

## Controlling for confounders

If so, you can include it in your model:

```{r eval = TRUE}
mod_e <- glm(cvd ~ pm10 + dow, data = chic,
             family = quasipoisson())
summary(mod_e)$coef[ , c(1, 2, 4)] %>% head(4)
```

## Controlling for confounders

You can use `ns()` from the `splines` package to fit temperature using a spline. Here, I am fitting a spline with four degrees of freedom:

```{r eval = TRUE}
library(splines)
mod_e <- glm(cvd ~ pm10 + dow + ns(temp, 4),
             data = chic,
             family = quasipoisson())
summary(mod_e)$coef[c(1:2, 9:10), c(1, 2, 4)]
```

## Controlling for confounders

Controlling for seasonal and long-term trends is similar. Often, we will use a spline with around 7 degrees of freedom per year. To fit this, first find out how many years are in your data:

```{r eval = TRUE}
length(unique(chic$date)) / 365
```

## Controlling for confounders

Then add a column for `time`:

```{r eval = TRUE}
chic$time <- scale(chic$date, scale = FALSE,
                   center = TRUE)
chic$time[1:3]
```


## Controlling for confounders

Now you can fit the model:

```{r eval = TRUE}
mod_e <- glm(cvd ~ pm10 + dow + ns(temp, 4) +
             ns(time, 7 * 14),
             data = chic,
             family = quasipoisson())
summary(mod_e)$coef[c(1:2, 13:15), c(1, 2)]
```

## Controlling for convergence problems

One way to account for "GAM-gate" is to change the convergence default threshold using the `control` option in `glm`:

```{r eval = TRUE}
mod_e <- glm(cvd ~ pm10 + dow + ns(temp, 4) + 
                   ns(time, 7 * 14),
             data = chic,
             family = quasipoisson(),
             control = glm.control(epsilon=10E-8,
                                 maxit = 10000))
```

Generally, it is good practice to include this when modeling air pollution-health relationships.

## Interpreting model coefficients

You can pull the model coefficient you're interested in from the model summary using this code:

```{r eval = TRUE}
pm_coef <- summary(mod_e)$coefficients["pm10", ]
pm_coef
```

## Interpreting model coefficients

Alternatively, you can use the `tidy` function from the `broom` package:

```{r eval = TRUE}
library(broom)
mod_e %>% 
  tidy() %>% 
  filter(term == "pm10")
```


## Interpreting model coefficients

Remember that this model coefficient is the **log** relative risk, since we fit a quasi-Poisson model. To get a relative risk estimate, you'll need to take the exponent:

```{r eval = TRUE}
exp(pm_coef[1])
```

Therefore, there is a relative risk of `r exp(pm_coef[1])` for each increase of 1 $\mu{g}/m^3$ PM\textsubscript{10}. 


## Interpreting model coefficients

Often, epidemiology studies will present relative risk for a 10-unit, rather than 1-unit, increase in exposure (e.g., per 10 $\mu{g}/m^3$ PM\textsubscript{10}). To estimate this, you need to multiple the coefficient by 10 *before* taking the exponential:

```{r eval = TRUE}
exp(10 * pm_coef[1])
```

Therefore, there is a relative risk of `r exp(10 * pm_coef[1])` for an increase of 10 $\mu{g}/m^3$ PM\textsubscript{10}. 

## Interpreting model coefficients

Sometimes, epidemiology studies will present results as % increase in mortality instead of relative risk. You can calculate this as:

% increase = 100 * (RR - 1)

For our example model, you could calculate:

```{r eval = TRUE}
100 * (exp(10 * pm_coef[1]) - 1)
```

Therefore, there is a `r round(100 * (exp(10 * pm_coef[1]) - 1), 3)`% increase in mortality for an increase of 10 $\mu{g}/m^3$ PM\textsubscript{10}. 


# Concept: Case-crossover studies

## Case-crossover models

\label{cc}

Case-crossover model designs are based on the idea of matched case-control studies. For these, instead of comparing averages of exposure for cases versus controls, you compare the average difference across each matched set of case and control(s).

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 3}
x <- rnorm(10)
y <- x - rnorm(10, mean = 2, sd = 0.25)
z <- rnorm(10) - 2
pos <- rnorm(n = 10, mean = 0, sd = 0.05)

ex <- data.frame(x, y, z, pos) %>%
        gather(name, value, -pos) %>%
        mutate(pos = pos + rep(c(1, 2, 2),
                               each = 10))
ex_a <- filter(ex, name != "z")
ex_a_sum <- group_by(ex_a, name) %>%
        summarize(mean = mean(value)) %>%
        mutate(position = c(1, 2),
               low_pos = position - 0.2,
               high_pos = position + 0.2)

```

## Concept of case-crossover

For each death in the dataset: Given that the death happened on one of the days in its strata, what is the probability that it happened on the day it did?

$$
Pr(Death | Stratum, Exposure)

This equivalence provides computational convenience for case-crossover analyses and a better understanding of time series models."

## Conditional logistic vs. GLM

Case-crossover fit using a GLM:

$$
Y(t) \sim Quasipoisson(\mu_t, \sigma^2)
$$
$$
log(\mu_t) = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}PM_{t} + \beta_{2}Stratum_{t} + Z(t)
$$

where: 

- $Y(t)$: Daily mortality count in community $t$
- $PM_t$: Daily $PM_{10}$ count
- $Stratum_{t}$: The stratum to which the day belongs
- $Z(t)$: Other confounders

# Implementation: Case-crossover studies

## GLM method

To code using a GLM, first you need to create a column with the stratum. In R, you can use `format`  with the date to do this easily, and then convert the formatted date for a `factor` class:

```{r eval = TRUE}
chic$casecross_stratum <- format(chic$date, "%Y-%m-%a")
chic$casecross_stratum <- factor(chic$casecross_stratum)
head(chic$casecross_stratum, 3)
```

## Case-crossover

Now you can include this factor in your model (note: this takes the place of model control for time trends and day of week in a typical time series model):

```{r eval = TRUE}
mod_f <- glm(cvd ~ pm10 + ns(temp, 4) + casecross_stratum,
             data = chic,
             family = quasipoisson())
summary(mod_f)$coef[c(1:2, 7:10), c(1, 2)]
```

## Case-crossover

You can interpret the coefficients now in the same way as with the time series model: 

```{r eval = TRUE}
pm_coef <- summary(mod_f)$coefficients["pm10", ]
100 * (exp(10 * pm_coef[1]) - 1)
```

Therefore, for this model, there is a `r round(100 * (exp(10 * pm_coef[1]) - 1), 3)`% increase in mortality for an increase of 10 $\mu{g}/m^3$ PM\textsubscript{10}. 

## Case-crossover

There are also other methods for fitting case-crossover models: 

- Armstrong et al. (Conditional Poisson models: a flexible alternative to conditional logistic case cross-over analysis) suggest using a conditional Poisson regression model (`gnm()`) to speed up computational time.
- The `casecross` function in the `season` package by Adrian Barnett uses 28-day strata (rather than by month) and a Cox proportional hazards regression model to fit the model.

If you are using this method for a paper, it is worthwhile testing the different methods to see if you get similar results.

## Case-crossover

Using a conditional Poisson model:
