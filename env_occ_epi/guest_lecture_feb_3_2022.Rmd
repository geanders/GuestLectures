# Climate change

## Weather versus climate

**Climate** is what you **expect**, **weather** is what you **get**. 

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "\\textwidth", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/weather_vs_climate.png")
```

## What is climate change

**Climate change**: "Changes in average weather conditions that persist over multiple decades or longer. Climate change encompasses both increases and decreases in temperature, as well as shifts in precipitation, changing risk of certain types of severe weather events, and changes to other features of the climate system."

## Projected climate trends in the US

> "Projections of future climate conditions are based on results from **climate models**---sophisticated computer programs that simulate the behavior of the Earthâ€™s climate system. These climate models are used to project how the climate system is expected to change under different possible scenarios."

```

Includes thirteen agencies in the US government: 

- Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Energy, Health & Human 
Services, Interior, State, and Transportation
- Environmental Protection Agency
- National Aeronautics & Space Administration
- National Science Foundation
- Smithsonian Institution
- U.S. Agency for International Development

See https://www.globalchange.gov/agencies for the role each agency 
plays in the USGCRP.

## US Global Change Research Program (USGCRP)

Key activities of USGCRP include: 

- Advance global change science
  + Observe changes in the Earth system (including through indicators)
  + Improving understanding of earth systems
  + Modeling global change
- Prepare for climate change
  + US Climate Reslience Toolkit
- Assess the US Climate
  + National Climate Assessment (NCA) every four years (includes *Climate Science Special Report* and *Impacts, Risks, and Adaptation in the United States*)
- Coordinate internationally
  + Coordinate US participation in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Assessment Reports
- Provide data and tools
  + Climate Data Initiative

<!-- ## Hurricane Floyd, 1999 -->

<!-- > "The medical examiner determined that 52 deaths were associated directly with the storm. Decedents ranged in age from 1 to 96 years (median: 43 years); 38 (73%) were males. \ldots \ Seven deaths occurred during transport by boat; flotation devices were not worn by any of the decedents." -->

## Direct and indirect deaths

- **Direct deaths:** "Caused by environmental forces of the hurricane and direct consequences of these forces."

- **Indirect deaths:** "Caused by unsafe or unhealthy conditions because of loss or disruption of usual services, personal loss, or lifestyle disruption."

# Conclusion

## Other topics on climate and health

The US Climate and Health Assessment covers several other topics on climate
and human health: 

- Air quality impacts
- Vector-borne disease
- Water-related illness
- Food safety, nutrition, and distribution
- Mental health and well-being
- Populations of concern
