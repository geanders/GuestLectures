## Assessing exposure to multiple hazards

Are there any physical hazards from the storm that you think are plausibly in the causal pathway for your study?

\bigskip

> "This is pretty speculative, but I've wondered whether **changes in atmospheric pressure** play a role"

## Pathways for indirect effects

**Survey question:**

\bigskip

> "Listed below are several ways that the physical hazards of a tropical cyclone can impact the built environment and so increase risk of adverse health outcomes. Please rank how likely you think each is as a factor in causal pathways for the health exposure(s) you are studying or planning to study."

## Pathways for indirect effects

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", fig.width = 7.5, fig.height = 5, out.width = "\\textwidth", warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
survey %>% 
  select(14:21) %>% 
  rename_all(~ str_replace(., "Listed below are several ways that the physical hazards of a tropical cyclone can impact the built environment and so increase risk of adverse health outcomes.  Please rank how likely you think each is as a factor in causal pathways for the health exposure\\(s\\) you are studying or planning to study. ", "")) %>% 
  rename_all(~ str_replace_all(., "[\\[\\]]", "")) %>% 
  mutate_all(~ str_replace_all(., "[a-zA-Z()]", "")) %>% 
  mutate_all(as.numeric) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = everything()) %>%

       y = "# respondents (of 12) rating as likely (4 or 5 on scale of 1 to 5)\nin causal pathways for health outcome studied ", 
       title = "Built environment") + 
  theme_classic() + 
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(0, 3, 6, 9, 12))
```
## Pathways for indirect effects

Other potential pathways through the built environment: 

\bigskip

> "**Communication infrastructure outages** (beyond power outages as it might be to do with internet cables cut etc.)"

\bigskip

> "**Damage to personal vehicles**, reducing capacity to evacuate or reach a hospital in an emergency situation"


## Pathways for indirect effects

## Aggregating data spatially




## Assessing exposure during evacuation/moving
