> ""This is not Harvey, this is not Imelda, this is not Allison. This is Laura. Every storm is different, and **we urge folks not to use any prior storm as a template** for what could or will happen. What we need to do is prepare for the worst." 

> \hfill --Lina Hidalgo, Harris County Judge

## Challenges for single-storm versus multi-storm studies

Survey comment:

\bigskip 

> "I have not yet investigated single storms, but I think looking at single storms **could help disentangle specific effects/phenomena**"

## Challenges for single-storm versus multi-storm studies

> "Next on my list of features to be specially considered, I would place the
**consistency** of the observed association. Has it been repeatedly observed by different
persons, in different places, circumstances and times?"

> \hfill --Sir Austin Bradford Hill

# Pathways for indirect effects

## Pathways for indirect effects

*Survey question:* If you think that any exposure-related factor---physical hazard or ensuing problems with the built environment, psychological stress, evacuation, etc.---dominates as a key factor for the outcome you are studying, please list that factor here and explained why you think it may have a very important role.

\medskip

> "One of my current studies examines whether children with asthma experience more frequent exacerbations of their symptoms in the months following tropical cyclones. I hypothesize that **exposure to bioaerosols (e.g., mold)** in the aftermath of the storm would be a key driver of an increase in symptom exacerbation frequency, but that there may be other factors at play as well especially immediately after a storm (e.g., psychological stress, interrupted access to routine care/medication)."

\medskip

> "**Power outages**, they likely lead to increased hospitalization for people dependent on electric powered medical devices."

## Pathwasys for indirect effects

**Survey question:** Do you collect and incorporate data on any of factors beyond the physical hazards of the storm (like wind and flooding) for your study or studies? Examples could include property damage reports, data on evacuations, measurements related to mold growth, surveys about psychological stress, or data on power outages.

\bigskip 

> "**Drinking water quality** samples"

\bigskip

> "I've been working on trying to obtain data on **power outages** from the ESRI utilities reporting"

\bigskip

> "No but I think **this is a really important direction** for future work related to my study."

## Pathways for indirect effects

Survey question: What are the biggest challenges or limitations you have faced in conducting or planning a tropical cyclone epidemiology study?

\bigskip

> "The question I've been doing some soul-searching about is whether **using information on physical hazards is a reasonably good proxy for exposure to the downstream hazards** that I think drive my health outcome of interest. I also wonder whether the extent to which a specific physical hazard is a good proxy across storms is modified by aspects of the built environment or the population exposed in a specific location."

\bigskip

> "In planning a study on mental health, I think major challenges include defining and accessing health data and **developing models to explore causal pathways**, particularly as outcomes may occur much later than exposures."
