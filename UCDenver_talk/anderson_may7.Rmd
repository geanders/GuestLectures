## County-level agreement in storm exposure 

\begin{block}{Assessing agreement in county classifications}
For each storm and each pair of metrics, we measured the \textit{Jaccard index} as a measure of county-level agreement in exposure classification for a storm:

\begin{equation*}
J = \frac{X_1 \cap X_2}{X_1 \cup X_2}
\end{equation*}

where $X_1$ is the set of counties exposed to a storm based on the first metric and $X_2$ is the set of counties exposed to the storm based on the second metric.

## Relative risk of mortality associated with storm exposure

\begin{block}{Relative risk of mortality associated with storm exposure}
We aimed to measure the \textit{relative risk (RR)} of mortality during the storm compared to what would have been expected the same days if there had not been a storm:

\begin{equation*}
RR = \frac{\text{Rate of deaths during storm}}{\text{Expected rate of deaths without storm}}
\end{equation*}

We assessed this relative rate for (1) specific days during the storm period (two days before to seven days after storm's closest approach) and (2) the total storm period.
