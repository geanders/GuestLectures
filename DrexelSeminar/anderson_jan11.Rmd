# Motivation

# Assessing exposure

## Hazard-specific metrics

- Distance from the storm
- High winds
- Rainfall
- Flood events
- Storm events

## Distance from storm

[Intro to best tracks]

## Distance from storm

[Importance of interpolating tracks]

## Wind exposure

[Reminder of best tracks, intro to Willoughby model]

## Wind exposure

[Factors of doing the modeling (transfering from surface to gradient and back, etc.), other applications of the model]

## Rain exposure

[Intro to NLDAS-2 data]

## Rain exposure

[Showing how to ID date of closest approach]

## Rain exposure

[Showing map from hurricaneexposure]

## Flood and tornado events

[Intro to NOAA Storm Events]

## Flood and tornado events

[Figure from `hurricaneexposure`]
