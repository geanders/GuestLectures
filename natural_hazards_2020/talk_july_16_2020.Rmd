## Synoptic meteorology

<!-- https://www.weather.gov/dvn/armistice_day_blizzard -->
<!-- The blizzard that struck the Midwest in November 1940 was the type of snow storm that engenders legends. Fall was extremely mild and across the Upper Midwest temperatures were well above normal on the morning of November 11th. So warm that at 7:30 in the morning the temperature at Chicago was 55 degrees Fahrenheit, and at Davenport Iowa the temperature was 54. Armistice Day 1940 was a perfect opportunity for many individuals to enjoy the mild respite before winter. Little did they know the most infamous duck hunt in American history was about to unfold.  When the storm exited the region over a foot of snow had fallen, and more than 150 people and thousands of livestock were dead. -->

<!-- Until 1934 the Weather Bureau offices operated 12-15 hours a day with two basic observations taken at 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. The observations were transmitted via telegraph. There were no satellite images and few upper air observations. -->

(midnight and noon Zulu time).

<!-- Today, NWS launches weather balloons twice daily from 92 stations across the U.S. to observe the upper atmosphere and provide valuable data for weather forecasting. -->

## NSF EAGER: Establishing Interface Standards for Physical Exposure and Human Impacts Data Collections and Publication in Rapid Response to Coastal Hazards

We are seeking to answer the questions: \medspace

1. For human impacts data, what are common scales of the data in **time** and 
**space**? \medspace
2. What are reasonable ways to **aggregate or extrapolate** exposure data
to these scales? \medspace
3. What are pathways and potential for **bias** from this data integration?

## Standards for human impact data integration

For human impacts data, what are common scales of the data in **time** and 
**space**? \medspace

1. Human impacts data are often aggregated by **geopolitical boundaries**.
2. Often, human impacts data has a time scale that requires **aggregation**
of exposure time series.



## Standards for human impact data integration

1. Human impacts data are often aggregated by **geopolitical boundaries**.

<!-- 2.  -->
<!-- 3. -->

<!-- ## Case studies versus multi-event studies -->

<!-- Standards are particularly important for multi-event studies. -->

<!-- To supplement case studies, multi-event studies can add:  -->

<!-- 1. Estimate typical exposure-outcome associations with greater precision.  -->
<!-- 2. Estimate typical exposure-outcome associations with less bias. -->
<!-- 3. Estimate and explore heterogeneity in exposure-outcome associations across events  -->
<!-- and locations.  -->

## County-level exposure assessment

Developing county-level exposure assessment for local peak sustained winds associated

## County-level exposure assessment

The `hurricaneexposure` package can be used to map exposures for specific storms:

```{r fig.align = "center", echo = TRUE, fig.width = 5, out.width="0.9\\textwidth"}
map_counties(storm = "Floyd-1999", metric = "rainfall")
```

## County-level exposure assessment

The `hurricaneexposure` package can also be used to identify all exposures 
meeting specific criteria:

\bigskip

\small

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
county_rain(counties = c("22071", "51700"), rain_limit = 100, 
            start_year = 1995, end_year = 2005, dist_limit = 100,
            days_included = c(-1, 0, 1))
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
county_rain(counties = c("22071", "51700"), rain_limit = 100, 
            start_year = 1995, end_year = 2005, dist_limit = 100,
            days_included = c(-1, 0, 1)) %>%
  slice(1:4) %>%
  select(storm_id, fips, closest_date, storm_dist, tot_precip)
```

## Recent and ongoing research with this exposure assessment data

This tool is being used to study how tropical cyclone wind exposures are associated with:

1. Risk of pre-term birth
2. Risk of hospitalizations among Medicare beneficiaries
3. Risk of broad-cause mortality
4. Population migration from a community

## Future directions

1. Creating exposure datasets for human impacts data at other geopolitical
spatial scales (e.g., ZIP codes).
2. Explore more and better ways to aggregate exposure data on the time scale
to provide relevant summary metrics to integrate with human impacts data.
