# Climate change

## Weather versus climate

**Climate** is what you **expect**, **weather** is what you **get**.

```

Includes thirteen agencies in the US government: 

- Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Energy, Health & Human 
Services, Interior, State, and Transportation
- Environmental Protection Agency
- National Aeronautics & Space Administration
- National Science Foundation
- Smithsonian Institution
- U.S. Agency for International Development

See https://www.globalchange.gov/agencies for the role each agency 
plays in the USGCRP.

## US Global Change Research Program (USGCRP)

Key activities of USGCRP include: 

- Advance global change science
  + Observe changes in the Earth system (including through indicators)
  + Improving understanding of earth systems
  + Modeling global change
- Prepare for climate change
  + US Climate Reslience Toolkit
- Assess the US Climate
  + National Climate Assessment (NCA) every four years (includes *Climate Science Special Report* and *Impacts, Risks, and Adaptation in the United States*)
- Coordinate internationally
  + Coordinate US participation in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Assessment Reports
- Provide data and tools
  + Climate Data Initiative
