## Project aims

\begin{block}{Project aims}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Develop exposure classifications of all U.S. Atlantic basin tropical storms, 1996--2011, based on reasonable measurements of tropical storm hazards
  \item Assess agreement between hazard-based county-specific exposure classifications
  \item Make exposure assessments accessible to other researchers for epidemiological and other impact studies 
\end{itemize}

\scriptsize Criteria for exposure classifications: \textbf{Distance:} Within 100 kms of storm track. \textbf{Rain:} $\ge$ 75 mm of rain total for two days before to one day after storm. \textbf{Wind:} Modeled wind of $\ge$ 15 m/s. \textbf{Flood, Tornado:} Listed event in NOAA Storm Events database.


## County-level agreement in storm exposure 

\begin{block}{Assessing agreement in county classifications}
For each storm and each pair of metrics, we measured the \textit{Jaccard index} as a measure of county-level agreement in exposure classification for a storm:

\begin{equation*}
J = \frac{X_1 \cap X_2}{X_1 \cup X_2}
\end{equation*}

where $X_1$ is the set of counties exposed to a storm based on the first metric and $X_2$ is the set of counties exposed to the storm based on the second metric.

# Software

## Project software

\footnotesize
\begin{block}{`hurricaneexposure`}
Create county-level exposure time series for tropical storms in U.S. counties. Exposure can be determined based on several hazards (e.g., distance, wind, rain), with user-specified thresholds. On CRAN.
\end{block}

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
county_rain(counties = c("22071", "51700"), rain_limit = 100, 
            start_year = 1995, end_year = 2005, dist_limit = 100,
            days_included = c(-1, 0, 1))
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
county_rain(counties = c("22071", "51700"), rain_limit = 100, 
            start_year = 1995, end_year = 2005, dist_limit = 100,
            days_included = c(-1, 0, 1)) %>%
  slice(1:4) %>%
  select(storm_id, fips, closest_date, storm_dist, tot_precip)
```

# Conclusions

## Continuing work

\begin{centering}
\small Relative risk for all-cause (left) and accidental (right) mortality in Miami, FL, at lags from the Hurricane Andrew storm day (lag 0) compared to non-storm days.
\end{centering}

```{r echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("miami_andrew_2.pdf")
```

\vspace{-0.2cm}
\scriptsize Estimates were obtained by comparing storm days to matched non-storm days in the same time of year and day of week in other years. Matched days were picked to exclude days near other storms. Lag 0 represents the storm day. Negative lags represent days before the storm and positive lags represent days after the storm. Vertical lines give 95\% confidence intervals.
