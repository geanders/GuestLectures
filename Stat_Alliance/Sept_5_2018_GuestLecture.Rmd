## County-level agreement in storm exposure 

\begin{block}{Assessing agreement in county classifications}
For each storm and each pair of metrics, we measured the \textit{Jaccard index} as a measure of county-level agreement in exposure classification for a storm:

\begin{equation*}
J = \frac{X_1 \cap X_2}{X_1 \cup X_2}
\end{equation*}

where $X_1$ is the set of counties exposed to a storm based on the first metric and $X_2$ is the set of counties exposed to the storm based on the second metric.

# Associations between tropical cyclone exposure and mortality

## Impacts in excess of official death tolls

Evidence from Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico. 

```{r out.width = "\\textwidth"}
include_graphics("figures/maria_timeseries.png")
```

## Relative risk of mortality associated with storm exposure

\begin{block}{Relative risk of mortality associated with storm exposure}
We aimed to measure the \textit{relative risk (RR)} of mortality during the storm compared to what would have been expected the same days if there had not been a storm:

\begin{equation*}
RR = \frac{\text{Community-wide risk of death during storm}}{\text{Expected community-wide risk of death without storm}}
\end{equation*}

\end{block}



## Seasonality in tropical cyclones

Storm occurence by month for three high-risk US counties.

```{r out.width = "0.8\\textwidth", fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("figures/storm_seasonality.png")
```

## Matching to control for seasonality

```{r out.width = "\\textwidth", fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("figures/example_picking_controls.png")
```

\small We selected unexposed days in each community, matched to each storm exposed day, ensuring all matches are on similar days of the year.

## Estimating relative risk of mortality

To this matched data, we fit a random effects generalized linear model, using an **unconstrained distributed lag approach** to explore risks in the period surrounding the storm: 

\begin{equation*}
log[E(Y_t^c)]=log(n^c) + \alpha + \alpha^c + 
\boldsymbol{\beta}\sum_{l=-2}^{7} x_{t-l}^c + \boldsymbol{\delta} Year_t^c + 
\boldsymbol{\gamma} DOW_t^c
\end{equation*}

\small

where $Y_t^c$: observed death count on day $t$ in community $c$; $n^c$: population size in community $c$ in year of day $t$; $\alpha$, $\alpha^c$: overall intercept and community random effect intercepts, respectively; $x_{t-l}^c$: indicator of whether the day at lag $l$ from day $t$ was exposed to the storm in community $c$; $Year_t^c$: year of day $t$; and $DOW_t^c$: day of week of day $t$.
