\vspace{-0.2cm}
\scriptsize Estimates were obtained by comparing storm days to matched non-storm days in the same time of year and day of week in other years. Matched days were picked to exclude days near other storms. Lag 0 represents the storm day. Negative lags represent days before the storm and positive lags represent days after the storm. Vertical lines give 95\% confidence intervals.

## Conclusion

\begin{block}{Closing comments}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Epidemiological research continues to identify new health risks associated with extreme weather. 
  \item Infrastructure may often play a role in the pathway between extreme events and health risks.
  \item Patterns in exposure to several types of extreme events have changed in recent decades and are expected to continue to change in U.S. cities in the coming decades.
