## Estimating excess

> "To estimate excess deaths in NYC during the COVID-19 pandemic, a seasonal periodic regression model, as is routinely conducted for monitoring the impact of seasonal influenza, was used. Excess deaths were determined for the period March 11--May 2, 2020, using mortality data from the period January 1, 2015â€“May 2, 2020 and calculated as the difference between the seasonally expected baseline number and the reported number of all-cause deaths."

burying the dead. Not the dead of sick and ailing with friends at
the pillow and the feet. She had come back from the sodden and the
bloated; the sudden dead, their eyes flung wide open in judgement."
