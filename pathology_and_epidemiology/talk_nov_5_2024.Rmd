# London Fog

## London Fog

> "Fog everywhere. Fog up the river where it flows among green airs and meadows; fog down the river, where it rolls defiled among the tiers of shipping, and the waterside pollutions of a great (and dirty) city.... Chance people on the bridges peeping over the parapets into a nether sky of fog, with fog all round them, as if they were up in a balloon and hanging in the misty clouds."

with cardiac disease"

"In all [10] necropsies, there was 'congestion of tracheal mucosa and

However, 'the diffuse superficial mucosal congestion that occurred throughout
the respiratory tract down to the bronchioles and lung parenchyma ... could
be attributable to fine irritant particles.'"

## Evidence from necropsies

\begin{columns}
\begin{column}{0.4\textwidth}
"In lung parenchyma, 'there were foci of haemorrhage next to areas of 
moderate oedema and desquamations of alveolar epithelium.' Pure carbon

alveoli or engulfed in polynuclear leucocytes."

particles in alveoli suggested that they had been inhaled a short time
before death. However, carbon particles should have been innocuous, unless they
had adsorbed irritant acids. The report writers thus postulated that: 'fine
soot particles, onto which irritant gases had been adsorbed, had a major
role in the noxiousness of the fog.'"

PM exposure to excess mortality and morbidity."

## Missing information

> "The 1952 smog stimulated extensive expansion of aerosol sampling in 
London and elsewhere, but actual sampling of the PM comprising the December
1952 aerosol was minimal, and to our knowledge no archival samples are 
available for analysis using modern techniques." 
\flushright ---Hunt et al., 2003

## Missing information

> "... by characterizing the form and composition of the PM ... we might 
obtain otherwise unavailable information relevant to exposures related to 
the high mortality observed." 
\flushright ---Hunt et al., 2003

## Great Smog of 1952

> "We consider it unlikely that London residents were exposed to some new
PM source during the smog event; rather, they were subject to an increased
dose of the typical exposure aerosol. However, increased levels of diesel PM 
were probably present in the London aerosol following the final conversion
of public transportation from trams to diesel buses in the summer of 1952."

Minimize \textit{error} in estimating number of \textcolor{red}{excess deaths}. \\
\medskip \pause
\textbf{Compromise:} \\

because number of \textcolor{gray}{baseline deaths} is estimated with 
some uncertainty.
\item Individual deaths aren't identified as linked or unlinked.
\end{itemize}

\end{column}
\begin{column}{0.5\textwidth}
\textbf{Strength:} \\
Maximize \textit{sensitivity}---the probability that if a death is classified as \textcolor{red}{"linked"}, it really would not have happened without the disaster. \\
\medskip \pause
\textbf{Compromise:}

> "The official report on the London episode ... noted morbidity and mortality
remained elevated from December 1952 until March 1953 in the region of 
Greater London. However, the report attributed these increased rates to an 
influenza epidemic, while recognizing some deaths may have been due to 
lingering effects of the fog."

# Epidemiology and Toxicology

## Epidemiology and Toxicology

Types of studies:

- Controlled animal studies with controlled exposure
- Controlled animal studies with real-world air pollution
- Autopsies of humans exposed to real-world air pollution
- Chamber studies of humans with controlled exposure
- Epidemiological studies of real-world populations exposed to 
real-world air pollution

## Controlled human studies

"I hope that I may have the privilege of being included among the volunteers to undergo such treatment ... if the fog has to kill us, it would be better to do it under controlled conditions so that there may be of some benefit to the rest of the world."
