## Relative risk of mortality associated with storm exposure

\begin{block}{Relative risk of mortality associated with storm exposure}
We aimed to measure the \textit{relative risk (RR)} of mortality during the storm compared to what would have been expected the same days if there had not been a storm:

\begin{equation*}
RR = \frac{\text{\# deaths during storm}}{\text{Expected \# of deaths without storm}}
\end{equation*}

\end{block}

## Seasonality in tropical cyclones

Storm occurence by month for three high-risk US counties.

```

## Seasonal confounding 

```{r out.width = "0.6\\textwidth", fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("figures/seasonal_confounding.png")
```

\small The probability of both tropical storms and mortality vary by season, opening the potential for season to confound measurements of the relationship between tropical storm exposure and mortality risk.

## Matching to control for seasonality

```{r out.width = "\\textwidth", fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("figures/example_picking_controls.png")
```

\small We selected unexposed days in each community, matched to each storm exposed day, ensuring all matches are on similar days of the year.

## Potential pathways through which tropical cyclone exposure might increase mortality risk

\footnotesize For each county in Louisiana and Mississippi, we measured the distance of the county's population mean center from the storm track (left) and modeled the maximum sustained windspeed associated with the storm (right).

\begin{itemize}
  \item For all-cause deaths, RRs were highest on storm's closest day
